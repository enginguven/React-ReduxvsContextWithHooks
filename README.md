# React Context vs Redux
Redux Hook and Context Hook were used in this project.


**React Context Version:** useContext and useReducer

  **React Redux Versiyon**:   useDispatch and useSelector

You can find components for two versions in the index.js file and select the same version in the movies.js file.

ReactDOM.render(`<AppRedux />`, document.getElementById("root"));

## Context Version

ReactDOM.render(`<App />`, document.getElementById("root"));
